  <h2>Here is an image I like (not mine):</h2>
  <img src="images/DragonKillsUnicornYay.jpeg" width="250" alt="A valiant dragon setting a unicorn on fire">
  <p>See here human, I do not agree with many people in society. When you think of unicorns, you might think of pure balls of good, glowing energy. When you think of dragons, you might think of bloodthirsty monsters. This prejudice has to stop. Dragons have been painted in a bad light by those who tried to defeat them. Dragons have been shamed for living in caves, having scales, and hoarding treasure. However, unicorns have been shown as givers of sparkly magic, the servant who bowed down to humans and served the knights in battle. Many people like unicorns more than dragons because they were followers, not leaders. Also, apparently they are prettier? This is a disgusting bias shown by humans. Another example of this is the way humans act towards butterflies and moths. Aren't humans just so stupid? Dragon's have been shamed for centuries. It is time for the dragons to break free and take revenge. </p>
  <h3>I was going to use this image as the Favicon but it was too small and intricate:</h3>
