    <h3>Spoilers ahead! I am not responsible for harsh feelings about spoilers.</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="maind2">
    <p>My favorite characters in Wings of Fire are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Peril! She is so funny, brave, stubborn, and passionate. I feel so bad for all the things she has been through, and I'm so proud of all her character growth and problem solving. If you dare insult her, I will hunt you down and - um - nevermind, can't say that in a school assignmnet.</li>
        <li>Glory: She is so sarcastic, and funny, but also tough and regal, like the queen she is! She's solved so many problems in her world, and still continues to make her world a better palce.</li>
        <li>Snowfall: She is a queen, just like Glory. She goes through a huge amount of character development in one book, unrivaled by anyone else. All fanwings would agree with me. She becomes much more generous and kind, while keeping her fiery attitude.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The rest of the characters don't have a specific order in favorites, but they are still really cool:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Whiteout</li>
        <li>Thorn</li>
        <li>Turtle</li>
        <li>Kinkajou</li>
        <li>Clearsight</li>
        <li>Indigo</li>
        <li>Moonwatcher</li>
        <li>Qibli</li>
        <li>Tamarin</li>
        <li>Fathom</li>
        <li>Blue</li>
        <li>Scarlet</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Here are my favorite tribes (there are ten tribes in the book series, each with special traits. I just feel like talking about them):</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Rainwings: They can shoot venom, and change their scale color (along with becoming invisible). That's just cool. Also, they're very happy and have pet sloths.</li>
          <li>Silkwings: They can spin silk from their wrists (If I were a Silkwing, I would crochet with it all the time), and are a very passive tribe, a personality that I relate to.</li>
          <li>Seawings: Who wouldn't want to be able to breathe underwater, have night vision, and glow in the dark at will?</li>
          <li>Nightwings: I suppose some Nightwings are evil, but some can see the future and/or read minds! </li>
          <li>Leafwings: The tribe dynamics have always been fun to read. Plus, some dragons have the power to control plants.</li>
          <li>Icewings: Their freezing frostbreath, glittery composure, and competitive society provide lots of intrigue.</li>
          <li>Sandwings: The poisonous scorpion barb on the end of their tails is very unique. Plus, the problems in their royal family did cause the entire first five books, and that was a very interesting read.</li>
          <li>Mudwings: Sorry, Mudwings, for not getting any plot development over 21 books... Still, I like their strong sibling bonds.</li>
          <li>Skywings: Despite my favorite character being from this tribe, most are just really grumpy and/or slightly bloodthirsty. </li>
          <li>Hivewings: They ... did enslave an entire tribe, wipe out another, and cut down almost all the trees on a continent. I mean, they were brainwashed into doing it, but talk about being bad for the environment.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In the end, I love tribes and dragons (except Whirlpool. Don't get me started on him. Or Chameleon ü§Æ).</p>

      <p style="font-size: larger;">Now for the ultimate question: Have you read Wings of Fire?</p>
      <button onclick="haveRead()" class="buttonyes">Yes</button>
      <p id="have-read"></p>
      <button onclick="noRead()" class="buttonno">No</button>
      <p id="no-read"></p>

    <div class="maind2">
      <p style="font-size: large;">Now I'm going to rant about Wings of Fire because I want to:</p>
      <p>Wings of Fire is the best Series in the world:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>There is just the right amount of suspense, fun and humor, heart-warming scenes, mystery, faith (non-religiously), equality, action, and the tad bit of romance. </li>
        <li>All audiences can relate to the stories of the characters.</li>
        <li>The stories themselves are epic too! Tui T. Sutherland has a great talent for weaving stories into beautiful tapestries.</li>
        <li>There is great representation about feminism, LGBTQ+, etc. For example, the norm is that the dragons are ruled by queens, not kings. Also, there are many dragons that are LGBTQ+, and they are normalized, instead of being recognized as "different": Anemone and Tamarin, Umber, Axolotl, Burnet and Silverspot, Jambu and Pineapple, Willow and Sundew, etc. Willow and Sundew especially are one of the Fandom's most favorite relationships. They are a forbidden love, but not because they are LGBTQ+, but because they are from two sub-tribes that despise each other. The fact that LGBTQ+ isn normalized in this series actually supports it more than commenting on it would ‚ù§Ô∏è.</li>
        <li>Through everything, if you are looking for a series about dragons, where the dragons are not human pets or the fixed enemies of humans, read Wings of Fire! Sure, there are some humans, but it's mostly dragons.</li>
