    <h2>Here are my three favorite classes from this trimester:</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="mainc2">
    <ul>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Yoga: </span>I find it very fun to relax and stretch/exercise with a balanced plan is quite fun. Doing it with my friends is even better.</li>
      <br>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Science: </span>Even with the enormous homework load, science is still pretty interesting. At the moment, we are learning about light and colors. The experiments we tested have used advanced equipment and have been fun.</li>
      <br>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">WEB: </span>Yes, the class that I made this website for is one of my favorite classes! I have always wanted to have coding as a major focus for part of my life. It was very exciting to finally be able to code real websites. (I have coded before, but not websites, and I didn't get to code at school.)</li>
