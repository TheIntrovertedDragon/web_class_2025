      <p>I have danced ballet at <a href="https://www.emeraldballetacademy.com/" target="_blank">Emerald Ballet Academy</a> (now not to be confused with Emerald Ballet Theater ðŸ™„) for a few years. I don't remember when I started, but it was sometime in elementary school.</p>
      <p>Now, I have performed in multiple Nutcrackers and spring performanced, produced by Emerald Ballet. I have also competed in the Youth American Grand Prix (YAGP) three times.</p>
      <p>On the spring of 2025, Emerald Ballet Academy will be hosting our spring show: a combination of King Midas and Giselle! <span style="font-size: small;">(This is not sponsored)</span></p>

      <p>I have practiced art for many years, and I enjoy it a lot. Right now, my main mediums are acrylic, sketch, and color pencils. </p>
      <p>I learn at two studios: Wenrui Art Studio, and Xiao Su School of Art.</p>
      <p>I have participated in many contests. Unfortunately, I don't remember all their names, though I did enter into the Junior Duck Stamp Competition twice.</p>

      <p>Along with drawing, I also enjoy crocheting, knitting, loom knitting, and occasionaly, embroidery. I am best at crocheting, and I have made many amigurumi projects.</p>
      <p>Here are a few things that I have made:</p>

      <p>I love listening to music. Right now, I'm in my 'sad music phase,' though I still do enjoy some happy songs. When I was young, I listened to Taylor Swift. Then, I started listening to Imagine Dragons and they became my favorite band. Recently, I listened to AURORA's music, and now she's my favorite, though Imagine Dragons is still a close second. Some of AURORA's songs that I like include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Runaway</li>
        <li>Running with the Wolves</li>
        <li>The Seed</li>
        <li>Cure for Me</li>
        <li>The River</li>
        <li>Soft Universe</li>
        <li>Exist for Love</li>
        <li>Some type of Skin</li>
        <li>Warrior</li>
        <li>A Temporary High</li>
        <li>A Soul with no King</li>
        <li>Your Blood</li>
        <li>Animal</li>
        <li>There are too many to list...</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some songs by Imagine Dragons that I like are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Thunder</li>
        <li>Bad Liar</li>
        <li>Radioactive</li>
        <li>Eyes Closed</li>
        <li>Whatever it Takes</li>
        <li>Demons</li>
        <li>On Top of the World</li>
        <li>It's Time</li>
        <li>Wrecked</li>
        <li>Children of the Sky</li>
      </ul>

      <p style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold;">I LOVE DRAGONS</p>
      <p style="font-size: 20px;">I will shout it from the clouds! Wings of Fire is my life and passion. Ever since that faithful 6th grader day, when I picked up the book and started reading, I have immersed myself into the wonderful world of Pyrrhia and Pantala. </p>
      <p>You may think I am exaggerating. Well, I'm not. I have created a style of drawing, just for dragons. I draw them everywhere, from homework, to school whiteboards, to any paper and pencil I get my hands on. I constantly connect Wings of Fire events to my life. I have a bunch of dragon stickers, stuffed animals, statues, drawings, costumes, etc. If there is a chance to incorporate Wings of Fire into a project/assignment, I will literally start shaking in anticipation.</p>
