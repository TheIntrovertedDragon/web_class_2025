    <p class="font" style="text-align: center;" >I don't want to spoil the stories, but basically, the first five books is about a 20 year long war, and 5 dragonets destined to end it. The second five are about the legend of Darkstalker, with many adventures of power and animus magic. The third five books are about the new continent, Pantala, where Silkwings are the servants of Hivewings and the Leafwings are supposedly wiped out. The side books add more information and depth to the story.</p>
